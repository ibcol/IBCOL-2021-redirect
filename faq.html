            <p class="paraText">The International Blockchain Olympiad (IBCOL) is an annual global competition inviting
                current and recent students to propose solutions for real-world problems with blockchain technology. In
                a worldwide hunt for blockchain talent, IBCOL combines the practicality of case competitions with the
                open-ended problem-solving culture of hack-a-thons, where participants submit a whitepaper like an
                academic conference and implementations of capstone projects.</p>

            <p class="paraText">IBCOL embodies the characteristics of a business case competition, an academic
                whitepaper conference, and a "hackathon" — contestants of up to six current and recent students first
                write a whitepaper to describe a complete solution, and finalists are required to create a poster board
                and a pitch presentation. This competition design rewards the students who can think deeply about a
                problem and the solution, and explain it to others in a coherent manner.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <p class="paraText">The mission of the International Blockchain Olympiad is to support sustainability and
                maturity in blockchain by working with academic, industry, and government partners. Primarily working

                <b>Promoting Awareness on Blockchain Technology & Applications:</b> students from
                around the
                world will benefit from the experience of participating in the IBCOL program of activities, which
                includes seminar series, specialised training and workshops, mentoring, and networking events besides
                the actual competitions. This will cultivate a genuine interest in the area of innovation, originality,
                creativity and cutting-edge technology. It will also instill the right ethical values in the younger
                generation to pave the way for their further exploration of blockchain in the future.
                <br><br>
                <b>Enhancing Employability by Equipping Participants with helpful Skills:</b>
                the prospective and actual
                participants will benefit tremendously from the IBCOL programme, as they learn practical skills and
                knowledge outside their disciplines and push the boundaries of their comfort zones. Students get a taste
                of the real world, and learn how to identify and overcome challenges in actually making something
                happen.

        <div class="row">
            <p class="paraText">The IBCOL was founded in 2017 at the height of the cryptocurrency bubble. While most of
                the world was distracted by ill-conceived ideas or outright scams, the IBCOL was one of the few that
                dared to ignore short-term gain for long-term development of the blockchain ecosystem. In its third
                year, IBCOL 2020 will be held online in the GMT+8 timezone. Participating countries may send up to 12
                projects in a three-day symposium this July.</p>

            <p class="paraText">The International Blockchain Olympiad (IBCOL) creates value for the students, for their
                academic institutions, for their potential employers, for their country, and for the entire world.
                <br><br>
                <b>Building a Talent Trust:</b> The purpose of this event is to nurture the next generation of
                blockchain professionals around the world. Participants have the opportunity to learn about blockchain
                from nothing and apply their knowledge in a design competition to see where they stand with their peers
                worldwide. Historically, participants of IBCOL have been offered jobs, internships, and investments into
                their projects with great continual success.
                <br><br>
                <b>Braving a Whole New World:</b> The world is increasingly online, and this paradigm shift will be
                accelerated in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data is the new oil and identity is the new
                money. The last decade saw lots of development on the information superhighway, but this decade will see
                a crackdown on bad drivers. Privacy is in the spotlight now, due to the Facebook scandal and the
                implementation of GDPR. The next frontier is data verifiability, where blockchain is a fundamental part
                of the ecosystem.
                <br><br>
                <b>Addressing Humanity's Challenges:</b> With the decentralization of training and organization to the
                national level worldwide this year, the first generations of certified and compliant blockchain
                professionals in many countries will trace their inception to IBCOL 2020. Many of these students will
                build the foundations of the trust economy in their countries. In due time, this community will catalyst
                the cross-border solutions to problems postulated by the UN SDG and other non-profit organizations.
                <br><br>
                <b>The Time for Blockchain is NOW: </b>As a technology of trust, blockchain will generate 3.1 billion
                USD in value across all industry verticals. Countries across the world are directly and implicitly
                forming national development strategies around blockchain. There is already a lack of qualified
                blockchain professionals around the world today. Just like how today’s big tech did not emerge at the
                start of the internet revolution, the most influential blockchain giants of tomorrow do not yet exist
                today.
                <br><br>
                <b>The Time for Students to get into Blockchain is NOW: </b>When students of today graduate a few years
                from now, there will be even more job opportunities in blockchain. As students and graduates seek the
                hottest jobs and employers fight over the best talent, the next ten years will resemble the internet
                boom in the 1990s.</p>

            <ul class="ulColor">
                <!-- <li><b>Whitepaper (40%):</b></li> a project is described in a document. There are no limits on
                    length or
                    formatting. Authors may write in any language but if complications arise, the English version shall
                    prevail.

                    <br><br>
                    <li><b>Posterboard (40%):</b></li> a project has a research poster to showcase at the IBCOL Finals,
                    14400×10800 pixels (36×48 inches @ 300 dpi) in landscape (“horizontal”) orientation. Poster board
                    content may be multilingual, but English must be present. Posterboard file may be in PDF format or
                    as a
                    Figma file.

                    <br><br>
                    <li><b>Presentation (20%):</b></li> a project may be invited to be presented; aim to finish by 10
                    minutes, hard-stop at 12 minutes. Presentation content and speech may be multilingual, but English
                    must
                    be one of the languages. Presentation files will be presented in 16:9 on either Microsoft PowerPoint
                    or
                    Google Sheets; a PDF backup is recommended.
                    <br>
                    <br>For each format, the projects may be evaluated by a jury of academic, industry, and government
                    experts
                    divided by those with business expertise and technical expertise on commercial (viability) and
                    technical
                    (feasibility) perspectives. -->


                <li><b>Problem & Solution (30%):</b></li> project addresses an appropriate problem properly. The
                problem is a complex challenge that involves various parties where incentives must be provided for
                coordination, reconciliation, and so forth. The solution must make sense to use a blockchain, rather
                than one that is oriented around a conventional cloud solution or database infrastructure.
                Commercial (15 points): the problem exists due to insufficient trust and the effort to build that
                trust
                is an insurmountable obstacle without the use of some technology to help coordinate and reconcile.
                Technical (15 points): the solution shows that blockchain can address the problem better than other
                technologies.

                <br><br>
                <li><b>Market & Partners (10%):</b></li> project includes the appropriate collaboration properly.
                The
                market is the collective size of the problem in quantitative terms, which further justifies the
                problem
                and provides a basis for revenue projections and distribution plans. A market is usually measured in
                terms of potential revenue, potential spending, potential users, or similar data. The partners are
                the
                entities that must be present for the solution to work — contestants need not have any relationship
                with
                potential partners. Typically, these are domain operators and regulators. A complete paper would
                describe the roles, responsibilities, and incentives of these partners.

                <br><br>
                <li><b>Competition & Risks (20%):</b></li> project is transparent about its potential
                vulnerabilities. Competition may be direct (any product or service that does the same thing), very
                direct (other blockchain projects), or indirect (can even be alternative processes). A complete
                paper
                may not necessarily explain why the proposed project is the best, but why it is different and
                therefore
                better. Risks are all risks facing the proposed project. Usually, the biggest risks are
                non-cooperation
                or non-alignment of incentives of partners. Other risks include technical, execution, business, and
                other risks that may be encountered by any business plan.

                <br><br>
                <li><b>Architecture & Governance (30%):</b></li> project has appropriate design fundamentals.
                Architecture refers to the technical design of the project. Justify why a certain blockchain
                platform or
                type of blockchain is preferred. How it interacts with non-blockchain systems, especially legacy
                processes and systems, technical or otherwise. Governance refers to how the project managed: network
                membership governance, technology infrastructure governance, and business network governance.
                Chapter 5
                in the Blockchain for Business book by Arun, Cuomo, Gaur perfectly describes this concept. Asset
                tokenization may fall under this category, which is how non-blockchain ready, or even non-digital
                “things” are represented faithfully and consistently on the blockchain.

                <br><br>
                <li><b>Value & Distribution (10%): </b></li>project has value and can be brought into reality. Value
                is about how the project generates value, which may not always be revenue or money. Distribution is
                about how the project will go to market and what the next steps would be.

                <br><br>For the purpose of awarding medals, if there are more than 3 projects with the top 3
                highest scores, the projects will be evaluated by an additional round of judging.

            <p class="paraText"><b>Individual Eligibility </b>— Any current or recent student may register as a
                competitor.. A current student is defined as a person of any age that is enrolled in a recognized
                academic institution. A recent student would have been a current student until 3 years ago (July 5th,
                2017). An individual may be attached to an academic institution by being ever enrolled in it. A
                recognized institution is an accredited educational institution or an institution that may grant a
                degree or diploma. All institutions and competitors must be registered with the <a href="./registrar/registrar.html">IBCOL Registrar Office</a>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Team Eligibility</b> — Projects are submitted by teams of one to six eligible competitors. Each team
                must nominate one representative academic institution, if any of the team members are from different
                academic institutions. This representative institution determines which country or territory the team
                and thus project will represent. Teams may be composed of members from different countries/territories

                <b>Project Evaluation</b> — The representative academic institution determines the country, and thus
                determines
                which local Blockchain Olympiad committee will evaluate your whitepaper. Thus, pay attention to the
                criteria for the requirements of each local Blockchain Olympiad committee.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Project Selection</b> — Each local Blockchain Olympiad committee may select up to 12 teams to
                represent
                their locale. Some select only on the basis of whitepaper quality, some also evaluate posterboard
                presentations and even pitch presentations. Some have additional interviews. Some have national or
                regional competitions. Thus, pay attention to the criteria for the processes of each local Blockchain
